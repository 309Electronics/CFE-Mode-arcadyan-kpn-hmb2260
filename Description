Before i begin i first want to list some disclaimers.
Disclaimer 1: I am not responsible for any damage caused to the settopbox!!! All the risks
and the fee your internet and tv provider gives you when you permanently brick the device is for your self!!!!
Disclaimer 2: I am still a thinkerer and nowhere near any expert nor might this be the right way.
Disclaimer 3: Only do it on devices you own and not to someone else's and knowall the risks when messing with the firmware, bootloader and linux os.
